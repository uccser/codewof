# Guessing Game

Write a program that plays one round of a number guessing game. The number your program is thinking of is `25`. If the 
user guesses a number below `25` then **print** `Too low!`. If the user guesses a number above `25` then **print** 
`Too high!`. If the user guesses the number `25` then **print** `Just right! How did you know?`
