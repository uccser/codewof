# Days of Coffee

The following function `days_of_coffee(money, coffee_price)` takes two arguments:

- A float, `money`, your coffee budget
- A float, `coffee_price`, the price of a coffee

It prints how many days in a row you can get coffee along with the leftover change. The printed message should be this in format: `I can get coffee {number of days} days in a row with ${spare change} leftover.`

There is a bug! It currently adds one extra coffee and gives us negative change.

Find the bug (or bugs) to fix this function so that it passes all of the tests.
