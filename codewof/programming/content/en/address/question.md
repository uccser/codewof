# Address

Write a program that asks for four inputs; a person's name, street address, city and postcode, and  **prints** out a 'letter address' for them in the following form:

- First line: name with first letters capitalized
- Second line: street address with first letters capitalized
- Third line: city in UPPERCASE followed by postcode with one space between

*Hint: the methods* `str.upper()` *and* `str.title()` *may be helpful.*
