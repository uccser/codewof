# Storeys Climbed

Write a program that asks how many metres were climbed during a tramp and converts this to building storeys.

In this scenario each building storey is 4 metres tall. Only include whole floors, ignoring any portion a floor we may have climbed. 

*Hint: The `//` (floor operator) will round down to the closest whole number.*
