# Days to Target

A particular population of butterflies doubles in size every day. Write a function `days_to_target(starting_population, target_population)` that takes two numbers:

- `starting_population`: how many butterflies there are to begin with
- `target_population`: how many butterflies you want

and **returns** the number of days that it takes for the population to grow to reach the target. If the target has already been reached (or exceeded), you should return `0`.

*Hint: a* `while` *loop is a good type of loop to use when you don't know how many times the loop will run.*
