# Calculate Mean

Write a function `mean(items)` that **returns** the average of `items`, a list of numbers.

The mean is the sum of the items divided by the number of items. Your function will not be tested against an empty list.

*Hint: the built in functions `sum()` and `len()` may come in handy.*
