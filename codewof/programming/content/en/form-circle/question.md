# Form Circle

A class is outside in a line to play duck duck goose. They must make a circle in order to start.

Write a function `form_circle(students)` that takes a list of students, `students`, and **prints** `{first student} and {last student} should sit next to each other to make a circle.`

Your function will not be tested with less than 3 students.
