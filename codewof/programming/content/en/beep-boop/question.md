# Beep Boop

Write a function `beep_boop(binary)` that takes a string, `binary`, representing output from a computer and **prints** a series sounds for a speaker to make.

Ones `1` should be translated to beeps. Zeroes `0` should be translated to boops. Each beep/boop should be printed on a new line.
