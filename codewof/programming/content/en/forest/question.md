# Forest

Write a function `is_forest(items)` that takes a Python list of strings, `items`, 
and **returns** a boolean (True/False) telling us if the items make up a forest.

In this scenario any group of items with more than one tree is a forest. A tree can be lowercase or start with a capital letter.

This function looks like it should work, but there are problems with it. Find the bug (or bugs) to fix the function.
