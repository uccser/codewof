# Pen Picker

The following function `pick_pens(writing_colours, is_marking)` takes a list of strings representing pen colours for writing, `writing_colours`, and a boolean (True/False) for if we are marking a student's work.
It should **return** the list `writing_colours` with `'red'` appended to the end if we are marking.

Find the bug (or bugs) to fix this function so that it passes all of the tests.
