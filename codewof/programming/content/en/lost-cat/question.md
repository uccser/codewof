# Lost Cat

Write a program that asks for a search location for a missing cat. If the answer is not `"food bowl"` the program should **print** `"Hmmm they are not in the {location}..."` keep asking until your cat is found.
Once the cat is found your program should **print** `"There you are!"`.

*Hint: a* `while` *loop is a good type of loop to use when you don't know how many times the loop will run.*
