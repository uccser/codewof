# Square Perimeter

Write a function `square_perimeter(side_length)` that **returns** the length of the perimeter of the square where the length of a side is `side_length`. 
The formula for calculating the length of the perimeter of a square is `p = 4s` where `p` is the length of the perimeter and `s`  is the length of a side.
