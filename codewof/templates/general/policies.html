    <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is University of Canterbury Computer Science Education Research Group's policy to
        respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our website, <a
            href="https://{{ domain }}">{{ domain }}</a>, and other sites we own and operate.</p>
    <h3>1. Information we collect</h3>

        operating system, unique device identifiers, device settings, and geo-location data. What we collect can depend on
        the individual settings of your device and software. We recommend checking the policies of your device manufacturer
        or software provider to learn what information they make available to us.</p>
    <h4>Personal information</h4>
    <p>We may ask for personal information, such as your:</p>

    <p>We will process your personal information lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner. We collect and process
        information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so.</p>
    <p>These legal bases depend on the services you use and how you use them, meaning we collect and use your information
        only where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>it’s necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request
            before entering into such a contract (for example, when we provide a service you request from us);</li>
        <li>it satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for
            research and development, to market and promote our services, and to protect our legal rights and interests;
        </li>
        <li>you give us consent to do so for a specific purpose (for example, you might consent to us sending you our
            newsletter); or</li>
        <li>we need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Where you consent to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind
        at any time (but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place).</p>
    <p>We don’t keep personal information for longer than is necessary. While we retain this information, we will protect it
        within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying,
        use or modification. That said, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure and
        cannot guarantee absolute data security. If necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance
        with a legal obligation or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural
        person.</p>
    <h3>3. Collection and use of information</h3>
    <p>We may collect, hold, use and disclose information for the following purposes and personal information will not be
        further processed in a manner that is incompatible with these purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>to enable you to customise or personalise your experience of our website;</li>
        <li>to enable you to access and use our website, associated applications and associated social media platforms;</li>
        <li>to contact and communicate with you;</li>
        <li>for internal record keeping and administrative purposes;</li>
        <li>for analytics, market research and business development, including to operate and improve our website,
            associated applications and associated social media platforms;</li>
        <li>to run competitions and/or offer additional benefits to you;</li>
        <li>for advertising and marketing, including to send you promotional information about our products and services and
            information about third parties that we consider may be of interest to you; and</li>
        <li>to comply with our legal obligations and resolve any disputes that we may have.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>4. Disclosure of personal information to third parties</h3>
    <p>We may disclose personal information to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>third party service providers for the purpose of enabling them to provide their services, including (without
            limitation) IT service providers, data storage, hosting and server providers, ad networks, analytics, error
            loggers, debt collectors, maintenance or problem-solving providers, marketing or advertising providers,
            professional advisors and payment systems operators;</li>
        <li>our employees, contractors and/or related entities;</li>
        <li>sponsors or promoters of any competition we run; and</li>
        <li>third parties to collect and process data.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>5. International transfers of personal information</h3>
    <p>The personal information we collect is stored and processed in Australia and New Zealand, or where we or our
        partners, affiliates and third-party providers maintain facilities. By providing us with your personal information,
        you consent to the disclosure to these overseas third parties.</p>
    <p>We will ensure that any transfer of personal information from countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) to
        countries outside the EEA will be protected by appropriate safeguards, for example by using standard data protection
        clauses approved by the European Commission, or the use of binding corporate rules or other legally accepted means.
    </p>
    <p>Where we transfer personal information from a non-EEA country to another country, you acknowledge that third parties
        in other jurisdictions may not be subject to similar data protection laws to the ones in our jurisdiction. There are
        risks if any such third party engages in any act or practice that would contravene the data privacy laws in our
        jurisdiction and this might mean that you will not be able to seek redress under our jurisdiction’s privacy laws.

    <h2 id="cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</h2>
    <p>We use cookies to help improve your experience of <a
            href="{{ domain }}">{{ domain }}</a>. This cookie policy is part of University of
        Canterbury Computer Science Education Research Group's privacy policy, and covers the use of cookies between your
        device and our site. We also provide basic information on third-party services we may use, who may also use cookies
        as part of their service, though they are not covered by our policy.</p>
    <p>If you don’t wish to accept cookies from us, you should instruct your browser to refuse cookies from <a
            href="https://www.codewof.co.nz/">https://www.codewof.co.nz/</a>, with the understanding that we may be unable
        to provide you with some of your desired content and services.</p>
    <h3>What is a cookie?</h3>
    <p>A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your device when you visit, typically containing
        information about the website itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to recognise your web browser when
        you return, additional data that serves the purpose of the cookie, and the lifespan of the cookie itself.</p>
    <p>Cookies are used to enable certain features (eg. logging in), to track site usage (eg. analytics), to store your user
        settings (eg. timezone, notification preferences), and to personalise your content (eg. advertising, language).</p>
    <p>Cookies set by the website you are visiting are normally referred to as “first-party cookies”, and typically only
        track your activity on that particular site. Cookies set by other sites and companies (ie. third parties) are called
        “third-party cookies”, and can be used to track you on other websites that use the same third-party service.</p>
    <h3>Types of cookies and how we use them</h3>
    <h4>Essential cookies</h4>
    <p>Essential cookies are crucial to your experience of a website, enabling core features like user logins, account
        management, shopping carts and payment processing. We use essential cookies to enable certain functions on our
        website.</p>
    <h4>Performance cookies</h4>
    <p>Performance cookies are used in the tracking of how you use a website during your visit, without collecting personal
        information about you. Typically, this information is anonymous and aggregated with information tracked across all
        site users, to help companies understand visitor usage patterns, identify and diagnose problems or errors their
        users may encounter, and make better strategic decisions in improving their audience’s overall website experience.
        These cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting (first-party) or by third-party services. We use performance
        cookies on our site.</p>
    <h4>Functionality cookies</h4>
    <p>Functionality cookies are used in collecting information about your device and any settings you may configure on the
        website you’re visiting (like language and timezone settings). With this information, websites can provide you with
        customised, enhanced or optimised content and services. These cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting
        (first-party) or by third-party service. We use functionality cookies for selected features on our site.</p>
    <h4>Targeting/advertising cookies</h4>
    <p>Targeting/advertising cookies are used in determining what promotional content is more relevant and appropriate to
        you and your interests. Websites may use them to deliver targeted advertising or to limit the number of times you
        see an advertisement. This helps companies improve the effectiveness of their campaigns and the quality of content
        presented to you. These cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting (first-party) or by third-party services.
        Targeting/advertising cookies set by third-parties may be used to track you on other websites that use the same
        third-party service. We do not use this type of cookie on our site.</p>
    <h3>Third-party cookies on our site</h3>
    <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals on our websites—for example, analytics providers and content
        partners. We grant these third parties access to selected information to perform specific tasks on our behalf. They
        may also set third-party cookies in order to deliver the services they are providing. Third-party cookies can be
        used to track you on other websites that use the same third-party service. As we have no control over third-party
        cookies, they are not covered by University of Canterbury Computer Science Education Research Group's cookie policy.
    </p>
    <h4>Our third-party privacy promise</h4>
    <p>We review the privacy policies of all our third-party providers before enlisting their services to ensure their
        practices align with ours. We will never knowingly include third-party services that compromise or violate the
        privacy of our users.</p>
    <h3>How you can control or opt out of cookies</h3>
    <p>If you do not wish to accept cookies from us, you can instruct your browser to refuse cookies from our website. Most
        browsers are configured to accept cookies by default, but you can update these settings to either refuse cookies
        altogether, or to notify you when a website is trying to set or update a cookie.</p>
    <p>If you browse websites from multiple devices, you may need to update your settings on each individual device.</p>
    <p>Although some cookies can be blocked with little impact on your experience of a website, blocking all cookies may
        mean you are unable to access certain features and content across the sites you visit.</p>
